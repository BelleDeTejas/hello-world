First Repository created for the Intro to GitHub on GitHub

This is just a test document for me to learn what is going on and how changes are made. They say that the "commit" is the same as "save," and the pencil is for editing. And you have to describe why you made the changes you did before each time you commit the changes.

And branches help you work on something before replacing the original code, or adding to it, or taking away from it.
